        <p>Video is the next step in our progression, being one of the most engaging formats available to creators today. It combines visuals, sound, motion, and presence to form a powerful tool for storytelling, teaching, and influence. As a result, it can significantly enhance a developer's ability to explain complex concepts, build a community, or establish personal authority.</p>
<p>Video content is more complex than the other formats we covered. It can require significant time, planning, and technical resources. You will have to wear multiple hats and perform various roles: write the script, set up lights and environment, perform in front of the camera, edit the content, and upload it. That's a lot of effort, but the reward in terms of impact and reach can be immense.</p>
<p>Video content is even more dependent on third-party platforms than any other type of content. You need considerable computing power for encoding the content, lots and lots of storage to hold that content (Have you seen how large a video file can get?), and ample bandwidth to deliver smooth playback to many viewers. Hosting your video content is rarely practical, so most creators rely on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Vimeo, and many others.</p>
<h2>Categories of video content</h2>
<p>We can look at video content through two main lenses: <strong>duration</strong> and <strong>live status</strong>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we can divide video content into <strong>short-form</strong> and <strong>long-form</strong>. Short-form videos can last up to a few minutes and are ideal for capturing attention quickly and delivering quick tips, teasers, or highlights. Long-form videos allow for deeper engagement and are suitable for tutorials, detailed walkthroughs, or interviews.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we got <strong>live video</strong> (also known as <strong>live streaming</strong>) vs <strong>recorded video</strong>. <strong>Recorded video</strong> is created ahead of time, edited, and uploaded on a platform. People can view this content after publication, replay it multiple times, and even download it on their devices. <strong>Live video</strong>, or <strong>live streaming</strong> is broadcasted in real time. Viewers must be tuned in on the platform at the same time to be able to watch the content. Depending on the platform, they can interact with the creator in real-time. You can also record it on your device and edit and upload the footage. This way, people can still watch your content, even when they cannot attend the live broadcast.</p>
<p>We can create a quadrant with the two directions as axes using these criteria. Let's quickly look at the video content categories we mentioned and the platforms where you can create and distribute that content.</p>

<h3>Short form recorded video</h3>
<p>Now that we've broken down the types of video content let's take a closer look at each category—starting with short-form recorded video and the platforms that dominate it.</p>
<p>The content in this category is usually up to a couple of minutes long. Most people record this with their phones in portrait format, do some quick editing tasks in the app, and publish the result. You can also create and edit the video on your computer, where you have complete control over the process, and upload the result on the platform.</p>
<p>The uncrowned king of short-form video is, at this moment, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, with a market share of about 40%. Google wanted a slice of the pie, too, so they launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/shorts">YouTube Shorts</a>, which currently has a share of about 20%. YouTube Shorts doesn't have a separate app, but it's integrated directly into the YouTube platform. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/">Instagram Reels</a> added short videos to Instagram's photo-centric culture and currently has a share of about 20%. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/">Facebook Reels</a> extends the same concept across Facebook, with a share of about 15%. Many other small platforms are popular in certain countries and regions, such as <a href="https://www.wechat.com/">WeChat</a> in China or <a href="https://chingari.io/">Chingari</a> in India, but they don't have much reach in the global scene. More information on the state of short-video platforms can be found in this <a href="https://sendshort.ai/statistics/short-video/">industry statistics article from SendShort</a>.</p>
<h3>Long form recorded video</h3>
<p>While TikTok has revolutionized the short-form video sector, YouTube has been the long-reigning king of online video sharing for more than 15 years. There have been many attempts in all this time to take that crown, but all have failed so far. I think the main reason is that Google owns YouTube and has direct access to its products: advertising, infrastructure, financial power, etc. Few other companies could compete with that. So far, none of the other giants have tried to compete directly with YouTube as THE video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Currently, YouTube is the most desirable place to publish your video content. You only need a Google account, and you can start publishing videos up to 15 minutes long. To <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71673">remove this limitation</a>, you have to verify your account, which is a relatively simple procedure. You can then upload videos up to 12h in length or 256GB in size, whichever is less.</p>
<p>All other big platforms have made changes to allow for long-form video content. On <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/camera-tools">TikTok</a>, you can record videos up to 10 minutes long, or you can upload videos that are up to one hour long. Instagram Feed Videos (former IGTV) can be up to one hour long (according to <a href="https://www.socialpilot.co/instagram-marketing/instagram-video-size-specifications">SocialPilot</a> or <a href="https://podcastle.ai/blog/instagram-video-length/">Podcastle.ai</a>.) Facebook allows <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/video-requirements">videos up to 3 hours long</a>. And LinkedIn allows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a548372">videos of a maximum of 15 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to these big players, but they don't have the same level of audience. Some might make great video hosting choices as they have better video players. You might want to have a look at <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>. Both are good places to post content before going on one of the more mainstream platforms. If you run a WordPress blog, they allow you to host a video with <a href="https://jetpack.com/videopress/">Jetpack Videopress</a>. You can try that service with one video no larger than 1GB, and you can remove the limit for about $11 or €10 per month if you pay for a whole year.</p>
<p>I want to make one special mention for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_video">180- or 360-degree videos</a>. They are can be uploaded on <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631">YouTube</a>, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1567022330264455/">Facebook</a>, and on <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/introducing-vimeo-360/">Vimeo</a>. These videos require special cameras, which allow you to change your view inside the video. You need a VR headset (such as the Oculus series, owned by Meta), a device like the Samsung Gear VR (where you mount your phone inside a headpiece), or simply drag around with your finger or mouse on normal displays.</p>
<h3>Live Streaming</h3>
<p>Live streaming enables developers to connect with their audience in real time, offering an unfiltered and interactive way to teach, collaborate, or build a community. Unlike pre-recorded videos, where you can polish your delivery, live streams are immediate, bringing spontaneity and authenticity. Viewers can ask questions as you code, request clarifications on the spot, or even contribute ideas, creating an interactive experience. This format is excellent for building a community, encouraging learning and cooperation, and focusing on human connection instead of heavy scripting and post-production editing.</p>
<p>Some popular formats are ideal for developers seeking to establish a community. A live coding session allows you to share your screen as you code, offering insight into how you think and make decisions. Pair programming or collaboration streams enable you to code with a co-host or guest, exchanging ideas in real time. Product demos gather instant feedback from viewers while showcasing new tools and features. You can engage your audience during a Q&amp;A or AMA (Ask Me Anything) session. Work-with-me or study-with-me streams attract viewers who appreciate an ambient focus session while fostering accountability.</p>
<p>Every streaming platform offers unique advantages. <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-do-i-stream-faq">Twitch</a> is popular among developers for its live coding features, strong community-building tools, and effective discoverability through tags. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/live-streaming-on-youtube/">YouTube Live</a> guarantees high visibility with automatic archiving, adding long-term value to your content. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a554240">LinkedIn Live</a> is perfect for engaging a professional audience. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722-Stage-Channels-FAQ">Discord Stage Channels</a> facilitate audio-focused conversations and community interaction, while <a href="https://help.instagram.com/292478487812558">Instagram Live</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1636872026560015/">Facebook Live</a> are excellent for casual announcements aimed at mobile-first users.</p>
<p>There are a few key points to consider when live streaming. Preparing a loose outline keeps you on topic and contributes to a successful live stream. Testing your technical setup beforehand is also crucial to avoid surprises during the stream. Promoting your event in advance through social media, newsletters, or community forums can help attract viewers, and recording your sessions allows you to repurpose them as tutorials or clips later on.</p>
<p>However, you should prepare for the unpredictability of a live environment since questions, errors, and technical issues can arise without warning. If you anticipate a large audience or a public stream, using a moderator can help manage interactions effectively. It's also important to pay attention to your background, audio levels, and on-screen content, especially when sharing your screen.</p>
<p>Although live streaming may not be suitable for everyone, it remains an incredibly personal and community-oriented method of sharing knowledge. Suppose you're willing to learn in a public setting and accept unpredictability. In that case, streaming can be a powerful tool to boost your reputation and foster connections with other developers, leading to a sense of accomplishment and inspiration.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>All you need to create video content is in your pocket. Any modern mid-range or higher smartphone can record high-quality video. There have been whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_shot_on_mobile_phones">movies recorded using smartphones</a> since 2005. The Pro and Pro Max models from Apple, the Galaxy S Ultra models from Samsung, and the Pixel models from Google - can all record great-quality video. Most can record video in RAW uncompressed or professional formats such as ProRes.</p>
<p>You can raise the bar as high as your budget allows. Nowadays, the options cover a broad range of equipment, from action cameras, point-and-shoot pocket cameras, mirrorless and DSLR cameras with swappable lenses to professional-grade cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Modern webcams can be a good starting gear for beginners, especially if you are live-streaming. There are great options from Elgato (<a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/facecam-neo">Facecam Neo</a>, <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/facecam-mk2">Facecam MK.2</a>, <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/facecam-pro">Facecam Pro</a>), Logitech (<a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/brio-500-webcam.960-001432">Logitech Brio 500</a>),  or Insta360 (<a href="https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-link">Insta360 Link</a>).</p>
<p>Live events can be an excellent opportunity to record content. On such occasions, you can make great use of the <a href="https://www.dji.com/global/pocket-2">DJI Pocket 2</a> or <a href="https://www.dji.com/global/osmo-pocket-3">Osmo Pocket 3</a> models from DJI. You can also choose a setup based on an action camera, such as one from <a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras">GoPro</a>.</p>
<p>Moving on to the &quot;classic&quot; cameras, Sony has an excellent lineup for beginners and intermediate users (<a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/compact-cameras/all-vlog-compact-cameras/p/dczv1-b">ZV-1</a>, <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/compact-cameras/all-vlog-compact-cameras/p/zv1m2-b">ZV-1 II</a>, <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10-b">Alpha ZV-E10</a>, <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/zve10m2w">Alpha ZV-E10 II</a>). There are great options from other well-known brands, such as the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-r50">Canon EOS R50</a>, the <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/p/z-30/1737/overview">Nikon Z-30</a>, the <a href="https://www.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-m5/">Fujifilm X-M5</a>. or the <a href="https://www.rtings.com/camera/reviews/panasonic/lumix-gh7">Panasonic LUMIX GH7</a>. Anything above this level is for creators with huge budgets and should not be considered by anyone just starting up.</p>
<p>Before dumping all your life savings into an expensive camera, consider two other elements that are even more important: sound and light. People will abandon any video with bad sound, no matter the visual quality. And a cheap camera with good lighting can get better results than a costly one with bad lighting.</p>
<p>If you record your content in a studio-like environment, look back at the audio content section and the list of microphones mentioned there. If you want mobility, then your best bet is a good wireless setup from a brand like <a href="https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless">RØDE</a> or <a href="https://www.boyamic.com/microphones-wireless-microphones">Boya</a>. Pick something that will work seamlessly with your smartphone or camera. All the tips about audio content apply to video content.</p>
<p>Next, we need to talk about light. Our eyes and any camera work on the same passive principle - light hits your retina or camera sensor and creates an image. Therefore, you want as much light as possible without being overwhelming. Thus, natural light is the cheapest and most easily available option. When sunlight is not available, you turn to LED lights. Here, too, the possibilities are nearly limitless, going from cheap lights from Temu, AliExpress, or Amazon to solutions from dedicated names like <a href="https://neewer.com/">Neewer</a> or <a href="https://aputure.com/">Aputure</a>.</p>
<p>Once more, don't jump for expensive solutions from the beginning. <a href="https://www.elgato.com/">Elgato</a> and <a href="https://neewer.com/">Neewer</a> offer affordable and reliable solutions for live streamers and videographers. Also, make sure you check some tutorials on lighting setups, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting">three-point lighting</a> system or this <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/blog/get-perfect-lighting-video/">guide on lighting for video from TechSmith</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, invest in a tripod or stand for your phone or camera. Jittery movement and camera shake can distract some viewers and cause motion sickness. Once more, the options are many. Some setups integrate a ring light and a phone or light camera support. More advanced solutions can have multiple attachment points. If you move around a lot, consider investing in a gimbal or another stabilization option. You can find suggestions and ideas in this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-phone-and-camera-gimbals">guide from PCMag, covering stabilization options for phones, GoPros, compact cameras, or DSLRs</a>.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Most media platforms have native apps that can handle basic recording, some editing features, and (when possible) live streaming. Therefore, you can take care of all steps from your smartphone alone, without needing anything else. If you want to edit your content further, you can use dedicated video editing apps. iOS and Mac users need not go further than <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193">iMovie</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933">Final Cut Pro</a>, while Android users can use the free <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html">Adobe Premiere Rush</a>.</p>
<p>Moving to the next level, we have the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/video.html">Adobe Creative Cloud for video</a>, which includes industry-standard products such as Premiere Pro and After Effects. A powerful alternative is <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">DaVinci Resolve</a> from Blackmagic, which you can use for free, or you can pay about $300 for the Studio version, which includes more tools, filters, AI support, audio plugins, and more. Further options are the <a href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/director-suite/overview_en_US.html">Cyberlink Director Suite</a>, <a href="https://www.capcut.com/">CapCut</a> by ByteDance, or <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/">Filmora</a> by Wondershare.</p>
<p>If you live-stream from your PC or need to capture your screen, you should look at <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, a free and open-source solution for all platforms. You can use it both to record video locally to be edited later or to connect to platforms like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> or to go live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/live-streaming-on-youtube/">YouTube</a>. Dedicated solutions, such as <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>, allow you to have online guests and record and/or stream interviews and podcasts to multiple platforms.</p>
<hr>
<p>Video content can be challenging to produce, but it's also one of the most rewarding tools in a developer's content arsenal. It allows you to teach, tell stories, and build trust in ways that text and images alone often can't.</p>
<p>You don't need to start with perfect gear or polished delivery. Begin with what you have—your phone, voice, and perspective—and improve with each video. Whenever you hit &quot;publish,&quot; you share knowledge, create connections, and build credibility.</p>
<p>As you develop your content strategy, think beyond the initial upload. Repurpose your videos across platforms, clip key moments for short-form distribution, and use live streams to foster direct engagement. Over time, your content will become more than a broadcast. It will be a conversation with your audience and reflect your growth as a developer.</p>

            This content started purely in a human mind, in terms of topic, structure, and end-goal. About half-way through, I gave in to the temptation and started using ChatGPT to provide suggestions and possible ways to expand and improve the content. The end result was enhanced using Grammarly to remove errors, fix punctuation, and fine-tune my non-native English. This process places the current content at Level 3 on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/ai-transparency-framework-cf89fa61dc1b" class="text-reset">the AI transparency framework as defined by Josh LaMar on the UX Collective blog</a>.
