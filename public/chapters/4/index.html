        <p>When creating and distributing content, audio formats followed the written word, not the other way around. The incorporation of sound into RSS feeds was first proposed in October 2000. This innovation led to the emergence of podcasting as the audio counterpart to blogging, although the term itself wouldn't surface until early February 2004. The evolution of this phenomenon is a fascinating topic, but I won’t go into much detail here. Instead, I will guide you to the Wikipedia entry on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_podcasting">History of Podcasting</a>.</p>
<p>The main advantage of podcasting over blogging is the manner in which content is consumed. Reading is an active process that requires you to focus on the words to understand them. In contrast, you can listen to audio content while doing other tasks. Indeed, many people listen to podcasts while driving, commuting on public transport, running, biking, or engaging in various other activities. Given that most podcast players allow for faster listening speeds (1.5x, 2x, or even higher), it’s clear why podcasts can reach such a broad audience.</p>
<p>I've extracted these statistics from the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2019/podcasts-who-why-what-and-where/">2019 report on podcasting by the Digital News Report</a>. However, it's far from the only source for similar information. Here is another <a href="https://riverside.fm/blog/podcast-statistics">report on podcasting statistics and trends by Riverside</a>. Did you know that the average podcast episode length of 25 to 30 minutes aligns with the average commute time in the US? This makes podcasts an ideal medium for developers wanting to share insights, tutorials, or updates, as they integrate seamlessly into the audience's daily routines.</p>
<p>The second advantage of podcasting is having one or more co-hosts. The interactions between hosts often impact listeners, just as much as the information being shared. Co-hosts also help diversify the audience by offering varied perspectives, experiences, and expertise, making the content appealing to a broader group. While we typically see two co-hosts, nothing stops you from including more. For instance, <a href="https://www.ladybug.dev/">The Ladybug Podcast</a> is hosted by four developers: <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian">Emma Bostian</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shidonichan">Sidney Buckner</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ASpittel">Ali Spittel</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly">Kelly Vaughn</a>. Ultimately, what matters most is that the hosts have good synergy.</p>
<h2>Things to talk about</h2>
<p>If we compare podcasting and blogging, a podcast episode is equivalent to a medium or long-sized article. Therefore, it should be approached similarly. You can even transform some of your existing articles into podcast episodes, particularly those that are not too code-heavy. This may seem intimidating, but remember that podcasts are the modern equivalent of radio shows. Consequently, there is much more flexibility in how you express yourself. Not every word needs to be carefully selected; the more natural you sound, the better your podcast will be received.</p>
<p>You might recall the statistics I mentioned and think, &quot;What will I talk about for 30 minutes?&quot; My advice is to consider what they represent — a median value. Plenty of podcasts have episodes lasting 45 minutes or even longer than an hour. This means many other podcasts with shorter episodes, typically in the 15-20 minute range. That sounds much more reasonable.</p>
<p>One possible source of topics is your own experience. You can discuss the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. You can also consider how you improve as a professional, your approach to learning new skills, and how you stay current with the latest industry advancements. Additionally, you might find inspiration in other podcasts. For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/jcutrell">Jonathan Cutrell</a>, the host of the <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea">Developer Tea Podcast</a>, features many solo episodes where he discusses <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/4df6425c">focus</a>, <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/e8ab707a">how to learn</a>, <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/6267e9da">how to approach programmatic problems</a>, and various other subjects. Solo episodes often cater to listeners who prefer concise, focused insights, while co-hosted episodes attract those who enjoy dynamic discussions and diverse viewpoints.</p>
<p>Another option is to have a co-host and discuss various topics together. You can compare experiences and see how a problem can be approached from multiple perspectives. Of course, this approach has its challenges. You need to get along well enough with your co-host so that your interactions are not forced or awkward. Additionally, you must find a common time window to record the show.</p>
<p>I mentioned the Ladybug Podcast earlier, along with its four co-hosts. Each of them has a unique background and set of experiences, bringing a different perspective to the topic of the day. Their case, of course, is exceptional. While most podcasts feature one or two hosts, this diversity effectively highlights the advantages of having a discussion partner.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you lack experience or haven’t found the perfect co-host yet! This is the ideal opportunity to turn to interviews. By chatting with other developers, tech leads, and open-source contributors, you can uncover valuable insights. They’ll share their experiences, enriching your understanding and captivating your listeners with fresh and engaging stories!</p>
<h2>Equipment &amp; Software Recommendations</h2>
<p>You don’t need a fancy studio to start your podcast, but having excellent audio quality makes a difference! Initially, you only need a good microphone, some decent speakers or comfy over-ear headphones, and a software program to help you edit your content. Let’s take a closer look at some options based on how much you’re willing to invest:</p>
<h3>Beginner Setup</h3>
<p>This level is based around USB microphones and free or cheap software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphones: <a href="https://samsontech.com/products/microphones/usb-microphones/q2u/">Samson Q2U</a> ($70) or <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/atr2100x-usb">Audio Technica ATR2100x</a> ($79). These microphones have both USB and XLR connections so you keep them when you upgrade later to an audio interface.</li>
<li>Editing Software: <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> (Free) or <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">Garage Band</a> (Mac)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intermediate Setup</h3>
<p>Here we have better USB microphones and some professional-level software. You can start upgrading with some accessories like a pop filter (reduce plosives), a boom arm with shock mount (better stability and reduced vibrations), or some soundproofing panels (noise and reverb reduction).</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphones: <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm58?variant=SM58-LC">Shure SM58</a> ($99), <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at2020">Audio Technica AT2020</a>($99), or the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000100.html"><s>Blue</s> Logitech Yeti</a> ($129)</li>
<li>Editing Software: <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Adobe Auditions</a> ($20.99/month), <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a> ($60 single payment for non-commercial, educational, non-profit, or very small business), <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/logic-pro/id634148309">Logic Pro</a>(one-time payment of $200, macOS only)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pro Setup</h3>
<p>Past the Intermediate level we move into XLR territory. These microphones require an audio interface to function. Be sure to research your options carefully, as some options might require extra gear to work properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphones: <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B">Shure SM7B</a> ($399 - needs a strong preamp), <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7db?variant=SM7dB">Shure SM7dB</a> ($499 - comes with built-in preamp)</li>
<li>Audio Interface: <a href="https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/podtrak-recorders/podcast-recorders/podtrak-p4/">Zoom PodTrak P4</a> ($150), <a href="https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-2i2">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</a> ($229), or <a href="https://rode.com/en/interfaces-and-mixers/rodecaster-series/rodecaster-pro-ii?variant_sku=RCPII">RØDECaster Pro II</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas to get you started. You can find more suggestions, guides and advice on how every aspect of podcasting on <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/">The Podcast Host</a>.</p>
<h2>Hosting and Distribution</h2>
<p>To share your podcast with the world, all you really need is an RSS feed and a reliable hosting provider. Just a friendly heads up: uploading audio directly to your web host isn't the best choice. Media streaming can use quite a bit of bandwidth, which might overwhelm your web host. It’s a good idea to choose a dedicated platform that's specifically designed for this type of content!</p>
<p>One of the most appealing options for beginners looking to dive into podcasting is <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a>. Owned by Spotify, this service provides free hosting and a user-friendly interface many users rave about for recording their podcasts on mobile and making simple edits. If you're seeking a bit more control over your podcast, consider exploring some of the various podcast hosting platforms available, like <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/">Buzzsprout</a>, <a href="https://rss.com/">RSS.com</a>, <a href="https://www.captivate.fm/">Captivate</a>, <a href="https://castos.com/">Castos</a>, <a href="https://simplecast.com/">Simplecast</a>, <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/">Spreaker</a>, and plenty of others — there's something for everyone!</p>
<p>Additionally, you might want to look into a publisher that can help showcase your podcast to a broader audience. Currently, three major players stand out in this space: <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/">Google Podcasts</a>, and <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>. A great podcast host will effortlessly integrate with all these publishers, ensuring your work reaches as many listeners as possible!</p>
<hr>
<p>Podcasting may feel a bit daunting at the start. Still, with a topic you’re passionate about and a steady commitment, it can become a fantastic way to share knowledge and foster a vibrant developer community. Begin with the tools you already have, and don’t hesitate to evolve your style as you go along. Most importantly, have fun with it!</p>

            This content started purely in a human mind, in terms of topic, structure, and end-goal. About half-way through, I gave in to the temptation and started using ChatGPT to provide suggestions and possible ways to expand and improve the content. The end result was enhanced using Grammarly to remove errors, fix punctuation, and fine-tune my non-native English. This process places the current content at Level 3 on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/ai-transparency-framework-cf89fa61dc1b" class="text-reset">the AI transparency framework as defined by Josh LaMar on the UX Collective blog</a>.
