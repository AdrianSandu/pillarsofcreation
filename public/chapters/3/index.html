        <p>The Web originated as a collection of interconnected documents, making the written word the original mode of online content creation. People began crafting online diaries or journals, with <a href="http://www.links.net/vita/">Links.net</a> by Justin Hall being the first such website back in 1994. As more individuals followed his lead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorn_Barger">Jorn Barger</a> coined the term &quot;weblogs&quot; to describe the act of &quot;logging the web.&quot; In 1999, Peter Merholz created the abbreviated term &quot;blog.&quot; Merriam-Webster recognized &quot;blog&quot; as the 2004 Word of the Year.</p>
<p>The true advancement of blogging was propelled by the launch of various blogging platforms, including <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/">Live Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, and most significantly, <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. The introduction of <a href="https://x.com/">Twitter (now known as X.com)</a> popularized the concept of &quot;microblogging,&quot; which was further refined by <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. In 2012, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn_Pulse">LinkedIn Pulse</a> were launched. Today, there are countless self-hosted blogs and a multitude of platforms that enable content publishing. These platforms have greatly democratized content creation, empowering developers and individuals to share their expertise and build audiences without needing technical know-how or substantial resources.</p>
<p>The history of blogging can be fascinating. To delve deeper into the topic, check out <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/03/a-brief-history-of-blogging/">the 2011 Brief History of Blogging on WebDesignerDepot</a> or the <a href="https://online.ndm.edu/news/communication/history-of-blogging/">History of Blogging timeline</a> by Notre Dame of Maryland University.</p>
<h2>Content breakdown by length</h2>
<p>One way to view writing is by considering the length of the content. This criterion enables us to distinguish four primary types of written content:</p>
<ul>
<li>ultra-short format (a couple of hundred characters)</li>
<li>short format (approx. 0.5K-1.5K words)</li>
<li>medium and long format (3K-10K+ words)</li>
<li>very long format (15K+ words)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ultra-short format</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/">X/Twitter</a> is both the origin and the undisputed leader in ultra-short format content. Launched in 2006, the platform allowed users to publish brief messages of 140 characters. This limit was increased to 280 characters in 2017 and has remained the standard ever since.</p>
<p>The most significant advantages of Twitter are the exposure and opportunities for networking. It's the &quot;global water cooler&quot; where you can discuss with almost anyone worldwide.</p>
<p>However, at the moment I'm writing this, Twitter is experiencing backlash due to its management since being purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022. Many professionals in the web industry have migrated to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. Unlike Twitter, this is a decentralized service, where people join a specific server or instance. If you want to explore the options Mastodon offers, you can check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/what-is-mastodon/">TechCrunch's helpful guide to Mastodon for beginners</a>.</p>
<h3>Short format</h3>
<p>Content in this category typically ranges from 1000 to 1500 words. It can be anything from describing your day to personal reflections or recent lessons learned. This is a common type of post known as &quot;Today I Learned.&quot; You can usually find this kind of content under the tag &quot;TIL&quot; or on social media with the hashtag <code>#TIL</code>.</p>
<p>Another possible format is to introduce a third-party article or resource. Start with a brief introduction, highlight the key insights you gained from the source, and then include a link to that content. Recently, I came across this type of content on <a href="https://www.bram.us/category/elsewhere/">Bramus Van Damme's blog</a>. Itâ€™s also found on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, especially in posts that say &quot;Shared by ...&quot; when they link to an external article.</p>
<h3>Medium and long format</h3>
<p>I'm including in this category content that is at least a few thousand words in length. In some cases, it can even exceed five digits. These are articles where you discuss a topic in great detail. It can be anything, from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/">an in-depth explanation of the CSS Layout</a> to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">a philosophical piece on the front-end developer identity crysis</a>, to <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/cloud-computing-aws-certification/">an introduction to cloud computing and AWS certification</a>, or the above-mentioned <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">technique on how to learn in public</a>.</p>
<p>A well-crafted article in this format can significantly impact your career. It can be a reference that people will revisit repeatedly and be eager to share with others.</p>
<p>This format is also great for guest articles that can be published on other platforms, allowing you to reach a much larger audience. Once it goes live, your article can showcase you and attract significant attention.</p>
<h3>Very long format</h3>
<p>Lastly, we arrive at the final category of written content: books. For developers aiming to establish themselves as thought leaders, self-publishing a book can be a powerful way to share knowledge and build authority. Whether you're compiling years of experience or expanding on popular blog posts, the process is more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>There are several options for selecting the best format for your book. It can be an eBook, a print book, or both. eBooks are cost-effective and can be easily distributed through major platforms like <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)</a>, <a href="https://authors.apple.com/">Apple Books</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/books/publish/">Google Play Books</a>. As an alternative, you can sell directly to your readers using services like <a href="https://leanpub.com/">Leanpub</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, or <a href="https://www.blurb.com/">Blurb</a>. Print-on-demand (POD) services such as <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon KDP</a> or <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/">IngramSpark</a> allow you to sell physical copies without worrying about inventory.</p>
<p>There's much more to discuss about publishing a book: how to structure, edit, and format the content, how to market and launch it, how to handle errors and updates, and more. But that's a topic for another article.</p>
<h2>How and where to publish your content</h2>
<p>When it comes to publishing articles, the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> model (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) is an effective strategy for maintaining control over your content while reaching wider audiences. This approach encourages you to first publish original content on your personal websiteâ€”where you own the platform, control the presentation, and safeguard against changes in third-party algorithms.</p>
<p>After publishing, you can syndicate your content to platforms like <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/">X/Twitter</a> to amplify your reach. The key is to include a canonical URL in these syndicated posts, which signals to search engines that your personal website is the original source. This not only protects your SEO rankings but also drives traffic back to your site.</p>
<p>I have mentioned <strong>guest writing</strong> above. It is the process where you are allowed to publish your work on a platform owned by someone else. Guest writing is a powerful strategy for expanding your reach and building authority in the developer community.</p>
<p>Many online platforms in the industry today feature guest writing. Websites like <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/">SitePoint</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, and others are built on this model. Each of these sites has an editorial team and a clear set of rules for how articles should be written, and they typically compensate writers with a fee for their contributions.</p>
<p>One key benefit of guest writing is credibility. Publishing on reputable sites instantly lends authority to your work, as these platforms usually uphold editorial standards that ensure quality. This credibility can enhance your professional reputation, making it easier to attract job opportunities, speaking engagements, or collaborations.</p>
<p>Guest writing also creates valuable networking opportunities. Engaging with editorial teams, readers, and other contributors can lead to long-lasting professional relationships. Furthermore, guest posts often achieve higher engagement rates as they appear on platforms where readers are active and seeking fresh content.</p>
<p>Additionally, guest writing can significantly enhance your websiteâ€™s SEO. By incorporating backlinks to your site within your guest articles, you attract direct traffic and elevate your site's search engine ranking, making it easier for others to discover your content organically.</p>

<p>There is so much more to discuss about writing. However, what we have covered so far should address the essentials. Let's move on to the next medium.</p>

            This content started purely in a human mind, in terms of topic, structure, and end-goal. About half-way through, I gave in to the temptation and started using ChatGPT to provide suggestions and possible ways to expand and improve the content. The end result was enhanced using Grammarly to remove errors, fix punctuation, and fine-tune my non-native English. This process places the current content at Level 3 on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/ai-transparency-framework-cf89fa61dc1b" class="text-reset">the AI transparency framework as defined by Josh LaMar on the UX Collective blog</a>.
